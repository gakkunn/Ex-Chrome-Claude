# Privacy Policy

Last updated: 2025-12-07

This Privacy Policy applies to the Chrome extension "Claude Shortcut Effective Extension" (the "Extension").

## 1. Information We Collect

The Extension does not transmit or store any personal information or usage data on servers controlled by the developer.

Settings you configure (feature toggles and custom keyboard shortcuts) are stored in Chrome's sync storage within your browser profile. This data remains on your device/Chrome account and is not sent to any external servers. The Extension runs only on `https://claude.ai/*` pages to provide UI enhancements and shortcuts.

## 2. Sharing with Third Parties

The Extension does not provide data to third parties and does not collect information for tracking, analytics, or advertising purposes.

## 3. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.  
If we make important changes, we will announce them via the extension’s store page, release notes, or other appropriate means.
