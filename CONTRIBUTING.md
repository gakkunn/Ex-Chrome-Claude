## Development setup

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gakkunn/Ex-Chrome-Claude.git
   cd Ex-Chrome-Claude
   ```

2. (Optional) If this project uses a build tool or package manager, install dependencies, for example:

   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev   # development watch build -> dist/
   # npm run build   # production bundle
   ```

3. Open the project in your editor and make sure you can see the `src/` directory.

> 💡 Please adjust the commands above (such as `npm run dev`) to match your actual project configuration.

## Running the extension locally in Chrome

1. Build the extension if necessary (example):

   ```bash
   npm run dev   # writes a watched development build to dist/
   # npm run build   # single production build
   ```

   If there is no build step, you can skip this.

2. Open the extensions page in Chrome:

   - Enter `chrome://extensions/` in the address bar
   - Toggle **"Developer mode"** on in the top right corner
   - Click **"Load unpacked"**

3. Select the folder of this repository or the built directory (e.g., `dist/`).

4. When you change the code, press **"Update"** (or the refresh icon) on the extensions page to reload and verify the behavior.

## Coding style & guidelines

- Follow the existing code style (indentation, naming, file structure, etc.).
- If Linters or Formatters (ESLint, Prettier, etc.) are configured in the project, please run them before committing if possible.
- Aim for small and clear commit messages.

Example:

```bash
git commit -m "Fix: handle null tab in background script"
```

## Making changes

1. Create a branch from `main` (or `master`):

   ```bash
   git switch -c feature/update-popup-ui
   ```

2. Make necessary changes under `src/`. Run tests or type checks as needed.

3. Commit with a message explaining your changes.

4. Push to your GitHub repository:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/update-popup-ui
   ```
