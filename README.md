Chrome Web Store: [Claude Shortcut Effective Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/claude-shortcut-effective/iimjloenddcpaddfdigacfegicopfdkg?authuser=0&hl=en)

## Overview

Chrome extension for claude.ai that adds safer sending, vim-style scrolling, wide-screen focus layout, and keyboard shortcuts for common Claude actions such as model switching, incognito chats, and quick cleanup. Built with Manifest v3 and Preact.

This is an open-source extension implemented based on Chrome Extension Manifest v3.

---

## Features

- Vim-like scrolling on claude.ai (j/k, Shift+J/K for half-page, Cmd/Ctrl+J/K for bottom/top) without affecting text inputs.
- Safe Send: Enter inserts a newline while Cmd/Ctrl + Enter sends, preventing accidental sends; toggle in the popup.
- Wide Screen / Focus: cleans header blur, widens the content area, and lets you toggle focus on the composer.
- Shortcut automation: toggle/pin sidebar, open new chat, start incognito chat, star/delete the current chat from the keyboard.
- Model shortcuts: open the model dropdown or jump directly to Haiku 4.5, Sonnet 4.5, or Opus 4.5.
